# GradeGrub Chrome Extension

Hey! I’m Ethan Rebello and I built this extension to help students simulate and plan their final grades more easily using data pulled from Canvas.

## About the Project

**GradeGrub** is a simple tool that pulls your grades from Canvas and lets you mess with them — like changing scores, dropping assignments, or setting custom rules. It’s meant for doing quick “what if” checks so you can see how your final grade might turn out. Use it to figure out what you need on that last exam, or just to set goals and keep yourself on track.
